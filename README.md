# Assignment-4 (LAB-10)
1) We Trained the KNN Classifier on MNIST Dataset.
2) We did Grid Search with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameter values for our KNN classifier.
3) We used the optimal hyperparameters found in the grid search to fine-tune our model and tested its performance on the test set.
4) We compared the accuracy of KNN classifier with SDG(Stochastic Gradient Descent) classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
